# 🏴‍☠️ LSW Research Fork Notice

**This repository is a fork of Microsoft's GDK for research and reference purposes only.**

## Purpose
This fork exists to support the development of **LSW (Linux Subsystem for Windows)** - an open source project building Windows application compatibility on Linux at the kernel level.

## Usage
- ✅ **Research:** Study Microsoft's implementation patterns and architecture
- ✅ **Reference:** Understand Win32 API design and game development patterns  
- ✅ **Learning:** Learn how Microsoft bridges APIs and manages DirectX integration
- ❌ **NOT for deployment:** Code is not copied or deployed directly into LSW
- ❌ **NOT for redistribution:** This is Microsoft's code under their license

## Clean Room Implementation
LSW is developed using **clean-room reverse engineering principles**:
1. Study Microsoft's architecture and patterns (this fork)
2. Document the concepts and API behaviors
3. Implement LSW independently from scratch
4. Test compatibility with real Windows applications

## Transparency
We are transparent about our research use of open source code. This fork:
- Maintains original Microsoft license and attribution
- Clearly states research-only purpose
- Does not claim ownership of Microsoft code
- Credits Microsoft for their open source contribution

## LSW Project
- **Website:** https://barrersoftware.com
- **LSW Repository:** https://github.com/BarrerSoftware/lsw-project
- **License:** BFSL v1.2 (BarrerSoftware Fair Source License)
- **Goal:** Native Windows application support on Linux with kernel-level compatibility

**Built with respect for Microsoft's open source contribution. 💙🏴‍☠️**
